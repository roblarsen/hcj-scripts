*Scalable Vector Graphics* (SVG) is one of the most powerful tools in modern web
development. A lot of the problems we were trying to solve 15 yeats ago are solved
elegently by SVG.

What is SVG? SVG is an XML-based markup language that is used to define graphical images. 
Think of it this way- What HTML is for text, SVG is for images.
